# Readnest Project

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This project is a **product landing page** designed to provide **ReadNest** book club users with information about the club, showcase upcoming events, and allow users to easily join the community. Its goal is to develop an application functionally similar to the freeCodeCamp [Product Landing Page](https://survey-form.freecodecamp.rocks/) project.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **HTML â†’** Page structure, tags, and semantic arrangements

- **CSS â†’** Design, colors, typography, and responsive layout

---

## ðŸ“š What I Learned

- **Hero â†’** A prominent section at the top of the page, usually containing a headline, brief description, and a call-to-action (CTA) button.

- **CTA (Call-To-Action) Button â†’** A button that directs the user to perform a specific action; for example, "Join Now," "Sign Up," or "Learn More."

- **Gap â†’** Sets the spacing between elements inside Flexbox or Grid containers, ensuring equal and organized spacing. For example, it can control the space between book cards.

- **Embed â†’** Embeds external content (video, map, audio, etc.) into the page. For YouTube videos, replace `watch?v=` with `embed/`.

- **justify-content: space-between â†’** Distributes elements in a Flex container horizontally with equal spacing, aligning the first item to the left and the last to the right. For example, the logo on the left and the navigation menu on the right.

- **flex-direction: column â†’** Arranges elements in a Flex container vertically, stacking them on top of each other.

- **grid-template-columns â†’** Defines the number and width of columns within a Grid container.

- **cursor: pointer â†’** Changes the cursor to a hand icon when hovering over a clickable element.

- **transition: background 0.3s â†’** Smoothly animates background color changes over 0.3 seconds (e.g., on hover), making the user experience more fluid and visually appealing.

- **Grid and Card â†’** Organizes page elements using a grid layout; cards separate content into sections and visually structure them. Similar to a magazine layout, the page is divided into sections (cards) aligned using the grid. For example, in an e-commerce site, products are displayed as cards arranged evenly across the grid.

- **flex-wrap â†’** Controls whether Flex container items wrap onto multiple lines when they exceed the container width.

- override etmek araÅŸtÄ±r Ã¶rnekle !
  .card p.price {
  color: var(--color-black);
  }

- **!important â†’** In CSS, it raises the priority of a property to the highest level, overriding other rules.
